## Adaptive-preregistration scope

This is primarily a publication repository, not a model repository. The adaptive-preregistration
protocol applies when work performed here will produce evidence for a public claim.

- A Jekyll build or preview, a design or publication gate, a metadata/content sync, and a test of
  deterministic site behaviour are maintenance. They do not need an experiment ID.
- A simulation, statistical analysis, benchmark, measurement, A/B test, or other run whose numeric or
  qualitative result will support a post or public claim is a citable experiment. Register it in
  `EXPERIMENTS.md` and follow `.agents/protocols/PREREG_PROTOCOL.md` before its scoring run.
- Results imported from another repository keep that repository's preregistration and experiment ID.
  Do not create a second registration here; preserve the provenance in the post and run the publication
  gate.
- Exploratory analyses may run only as exploratory work and must not be presented as preregistered
  evidence.

# Agent protocols

This repo uses **KIT Adaptive Preregistration**: agent protocols that are maintained in one central repo and vendored into `.agents/`. Every agent follows them, whatever the tool (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, ChatGPT…).

- The rules in this block and the documents in `.agents/protocols/` are binding. If a task conflicts with one, stop and say so before doing the task.
- Project-specific instructions (outside these markers, or in nested `AGENTS.md` files) may add to the protocols. If one contradicts a protocol, ask the user which wins.
- Don't edit files in `.agents/` or text between the `kit_ap` markers. Updates overwrite them. To change a protocol, propose the change to the user as an edit to the kit repo.
- If a session-start message says the protocols are out of date, tell the user once. Don't update without their go-ahead. If your tool has no hooks, run `.agents/bin/kit_ap check` once at the start of a session.

## Preregistration

Read and obey `.agents/protocols/PREREG_PROTOCOL.md` before running, modifying, or reporting any experiment.
